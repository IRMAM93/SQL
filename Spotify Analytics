--  For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into it.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

-- Create Spotify table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

-- I then inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

-- Lastly, I explored the data using the SQL below.

-- What are the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT popularity, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What songs were from Bad Bunny and what were their liveliness and tempo.
SELECT track_name, artist_name, liveness, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Bad Bunny';

-- Show all artist with 'The' in their artistic name.
SELECT artist_name 
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name LIKE '%the%';
 
-- What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

-- Show songs listed by popularity beginning with the least popular first.
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity;
